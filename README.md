# PyBer Analysis
# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to summarize the ride-share app data by the type of city (Rural, Suburban, Urban) and visualize the total weekly fares for each type city. This will be done using pandas DataFrames and MatPlotlib graphing in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

The summary data clearly indicates that Urban cities have the most rides and drivers and generate the most revenue, followed by suburban than rural. However, the average fare per ride by city shows an inverse relationship, where Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride with suburban and rural cities have higher average fares. As with the average fare per ride, the average fare per driver shows a similar relationship where Rural cities have the highest fare per driver, followed by suburban than urban.
