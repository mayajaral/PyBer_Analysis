# PyBer Analysis
# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to summarize the ride-share app data by the type of city (Rural, Suburban, Urban) and visualize the total weekly fares for each type city. This will be done using pandas DataFrames and MatPlotlib graphing in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

The summary data clearly indicates that Urban cities have the most rides and drivers and generate the most revenue, followed by suburban than rural. However, the average fare per ride by city shows an inverse relationship, where Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride with suburban and rural cities have higher average fares. As with the average fare per ride, the average fare per driver shows a similar relationship where Rural cities have the highest fare per driver, followed by suburban than urban.

The Total Fare by City type per week confirms the fact that Urban cities have the highest total fare per week, followed by suburban then rural. Urban is more than twice that of Suburban and four times that of rural. We can also see that here is a spike in the total fare at the end of Febuary. Urban and Rural cities see a drop through March while Urban cities show a fluctuating total fare.

# Summary
Recommendations for the CEO addressing disparities among city types-
1. Urban cities have the highest revenue and thus should be focused on to increase output.
2. All three types of cities show similar trends for the first half of the year. However, in the later half the reason for the drop in suburban and rural cities should be researched, as well as the highly fluctuating nature of the total fare in Urban cities between March and April.
3.The reason for the end of Febuary peak should also be determined, to see if it replicable to other times in the year. 
4. Suburban cities show a sharp increase at the end of the year while Rural and Urban cities both show a drop. The reasons for this should be researched for cross-applicability.
